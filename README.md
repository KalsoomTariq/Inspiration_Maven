Inspiration Maven resides in a cozy library, where ivy intertwines with bookshelves and sunlight streams through stained-glass windows. Her homespace is designed to evoke a sense of tranquility and intellectual curiosity, inviting users to embark on their literary journey.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: The user describes their life goal (e.g., "I want to improve my time management").
2. **Goal Analysis**: The AI processes the input and categorizes it into predefined themes (e.g., productivity, creativity, mindfulness).
3. **API Query**: Using the Open Library API, the AI fetches book recommendations relevant to the identified theme.
4. **Recommendations**: The user receives a curated list of books along with brief descriptions.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Learning**: Implement user feedback to refine recommendations over time.
- **Multilingual Support**: Enable recommendations in multiple languages.
- **Integration with E-Book Platforms**: Provide direct links to purchase or download recommended books.
